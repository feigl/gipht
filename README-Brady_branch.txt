# README for Brady branch of GIPhT
 This branch contains scripts and data specific to a study at Brady documented in the manuscript entitled "Time-series Analysis of Volume Change at Brady Hot Springs, Nevada, USA using Geodetic Data from 2003 - 2018" (authored by Elena C Reinisch, Michael Cardiff, Corne Kreemer, John Akerley, and Kurt L. Feigl).  This manuscript was submitted to JGR-Solid Earth and is currently under consideration for publication.

# Study specific directories:
## deployment
This directory contains files and scripts specific time-series analysis (using temporal adjustment) of the deforming region at Brady using GPS and InSAR data.  The time-series analysis focuses time intervals where well operations were varied at the site.

## GPS
This directory contains the GPS data used in this study.

## graphtreeta_voxels
This directory contains the scripts for voxel-wise time-series analysis (using temporal adjustment). It also contains the voxel files derived for each pair using the ``multi-cube'' paramterization desribed in Reinisch et al. (2018, GJI).
